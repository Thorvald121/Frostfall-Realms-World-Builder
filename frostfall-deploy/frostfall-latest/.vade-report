## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 16.1.6 project using App Router.

### Changes Made:

1. **Installed Package:**
   - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 to project dependencies using pnpm
   - Package manager: pnpm (detected from pnpm-lock.yaml)

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `app/layout.jsx`: 
     - Added import for SpeedInsights component from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
     - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag after {children}
     - Preserved existing code structure, fonts, and styling

3. **Updated Dependencies:**
   - `package.json`: Added @vercel/speed-insights ^1.3.1 to dependencies
   - `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Updated with new package and its dependencies

### Implementation Details:

- **Next.js Version**: 16.1.6 (App Router)
- **Route Type**: App Router (confirmed by presence of app/layout.jsx)
- **Import Source**: '@vercel/speed-insights/next' (correct for Next.js 13.5+)
- **Component Placement**: Inside <body> tag after {children} per best practices

### Verification Completed:

✓ Build successful: `pnpm run build` completed without errors
✓ Package installed: @vercel/speed-insights@1.3.1 added to dependencies
✓ Lock file updated: pnpm-lock.yaml properly updated with new dependencies
✓ No build artifacts staged (checked .next directory is properly gitignored)
✓ All source files properly staged for commit

### Notes:

- The SpeedInsights component will automatically track Core Web Vitals and page navigation performance
- No additional configuration required - the component works out of the box
- The component is non-blocking and won't affect page performance
- Analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard when deployed
- This implementation follows Vercel's recommended approach for Next.js App Router projects
