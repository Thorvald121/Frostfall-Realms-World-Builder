# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using pnpm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the new dependency tree

### 2. Code Changes

**Modified: app/layout.jsx**
- Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the existing `<Analytics />` component

## Implementation Details

The project uses:
- **Next.js version**: 14.2.35 (supports App Router)
- **Router type**: App Router (app directory structure)
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Root layout**: app/layout.jsx

Since the Next.js version is 14.2.35 (which is > 13.5) and uses App Router, the implementation follows the recommended approach:
- Imported SpeedInsights from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
- Added the component directly to the root layout without any additional configuration
- The component is placed after {children} and alongside the existing Analytics component

## Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully (`pnpm run build`)
- ✅ No TypeScript/compilation errors
- ✅ Package.json and lock file updated correctly
- ✅ Component properly integrated into the application structure

## Files Modified

1. `app/layout.jsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component
2. `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
3. `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new dependency resolution

The implementation preserves all existing code structure and only adds the necessary changes for Vercel Speed Insights integration.
