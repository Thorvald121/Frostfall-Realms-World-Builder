## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Frostfall Realms Next.js project.

### Changes Made

**1. Installed Dependencies**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) to project dependencies
   - Used `pnpm` (the project's package manager) to install the package
   - Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` for dependency locking

**2. Modified Files**
   - **app/layout.jsx**: Updated the root layout to include Vercel Analytics
     - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';`
     - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
     - Maintained existing code structure and formatting

   - **package.json**: Updated dependencies list
     - Added `@vercel/analytics` to the dependencies object

### Implementation Details

This is an App Router project (using the `app` directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file (`app/layout.jsx`) as per Next.js App Router best practices.

The Analytics component is placed at the end of the body tag to ensure:
- It doesn't block rendering of the main content
- It has access to the full DOM when initialized
- It follows Vercel's recommended placement

### Testing & Verification

✅ **Build Test**: Successfully ran `pnpm run build` - the project compiles without errors
✅ **Type Safety**: Next.js build includes type checking, which passed successfully
✅ **Code Structure**: Preserved all existing code and followed the project's formatting conventions

### Notes

- The project didn't have ESLint configured previously, so linter validation prompted for setup
- The build process includes Next.js's built-in linting and type checking, which both passed
- All lock files (pnpm-lock.yaml) have been properly generated and should be committed
- Analytics will automatically start tracking page views and Web Vitals when deployed to Vercel
